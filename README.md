Hi my names christian i like to code and play video games.
But that will change because im devoting my next year to understand god.
what I know so far
GOD LOVES US
The only way to get to him is to believe his son jesus died for us
God forgives evrything and all things.
there is one god
He hhas basic instructions for us to follow
being a person of god is not easy
We need to have a relationship with god
we need to love god with everything we got
we will go through trials and tribulations
God is love
